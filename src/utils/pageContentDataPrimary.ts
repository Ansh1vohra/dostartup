A hallmark certifies the actual gold or silver content in jewellery or other precious articles. The BIS Hallmark is an official certification process in India that assures consumers of the purity of gold or silver jewellery being sold. To ensure accurate testing and certification, jewellery is assessed at BIS-approved Assaying and Hallmarking Centres (AHCs) located across India. These centres are governed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which outlines the procedures for granting, renewing, suspending, and cancelling the recognition of such centres."

The main objective is to identify and measure contamination in soil and groundwater, refine site characterization, and evaluate potential risks to human health, the environment, and property development. The process includes geophysical surveys, drilling, utility clearance, and laboratory testing, all performed following strict standards such as ASTM guidelines. Certified experts prepare detailed reports with findings and recommendations, ensuring compliance with environmental regulations. Key advantages include early detection of environmental hazards, optimized project planning, regulatory adherence, and improved community and environmental health. These investigations are vital for sustainable development by supporting informed decision-making that balances economic growth with ecological preservation."

        "content": "Consent to Establishment (CTE) from the Pollution Control Board, also known as Consent for Establishment from the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB), is a mandatory environmental clearance required for controlling industrial discharges, including air pollutants, wastewater, and noise emissions. Industries are classified into Red (high pollution), Orange (moderate pollution), and Green (low pollution) categories based on the level of pollution they generate. In some states, there is also a White Category, which exempts certain industries from needing formal NOCs but still requires a basic application submission containing business details. The State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) and Pollution Control Committees (PCCs), under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, oversee such industrial setups. Entrepreneurs must obtain a Consent to Establish before initiating operations and later apply for Consent to Operate (CTO) to begin functioning."

This environmental approval ensures the unit aligns with pollution prevention and control norms. The SPCBs are responsible for issuing CTE in respective states, while PCCs carry out the same duties in Union Territories. Acquiring this certificate is a critical compliance step for any new industrial activity and must be completed alongside other statutory approvals. It ensures alignment with the country’s environmental protection regulations."

These buildings not only mitigate environmental damage but also offer positive benefits such as conserving natural resources and enhancing quality of life. Green buildings adopt responsible practices throughout their lifecycle, including planning, design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and demolition. In India, green-certified buildings enjoy various government benefits such as tax incentives, easier loan access, environmental advantages, and state-level subsidies."

The ultimate goal is to reduce carbon emissions and enhance the well-being of occupants through naturally comfortable environments. This is achieved by lowering both operational and embodied carbon emissions, using renewable energy sources, and reducing non-biodegradable waste. To comply with IGBC standards, buildings must incorporate key features like sustainable landscaping, efficient waste management, eco-friendly materials, water conservation mechanisms, energy-efficient systems, integration of renewable energy sources, and adequate natural ventilation and daylight."

NGO Accounting is the system used to record and report all financial transactions related to such activities. It involves selecting the right accounting method, staying compliant with tax laws, and accurately preparing financial statements. Since NGOs receive funds through donations and contributions without expecting returns, their accounting practices are tailored to reflect their mission-driven operations. Unlike for-profit entities, NGOs focus on keeping administrative costs low, so most of the funds go directly into social programs and services.
