A legal notice serves as a formal communication between the creditor (aggrieved party) and the debtor (defaulting party), indicating that legal proceedings will follow if the dues are not cleared. This notice may be sent to any individual—including friends, relatives, business associates, or companies—who have borrowed money and failed to repay it as agreed.
